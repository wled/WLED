### What am I looking at?
Each lit LED represents a scheduled departure. The color identifies the bus/train.

As buses/trains get closer to departure they move towards the center of the display.

The tape marks above and below the center tape mark show a good time to leave to catch a particular bus/train.

The top half of the display shows transit arriving from the north and heading south.

The bottom half of the display  shows transit arriving from the south and heading north.

The tape in the middle represents the point of departure.

The DepartStrip connects to the official transit feeds and updates the estimates every minute.

When multiple estimates are scheduled for the same time the lights will alternate between each of their colors.
