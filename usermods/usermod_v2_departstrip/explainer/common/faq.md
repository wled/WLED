### What am I looking at?
Each lit LED represents a scheduled departure. The color identifies
the bus/train.  The top of strip shows transit arriving from the north
and heading south.  The bottom of the strip shows transit arriving
from the south and heading north.  The tape in the middle represents
the point of departure.  The marks above and below the center mark
show a good time to leave to catch a particular bus/train.

Each minute the DepartStrip connects to the official transit feeds and
updates the estimates.

When multiple transit departure estimates converge the lights will
alternate between each of their colors.

### How do I connect it to my WiFi the first time (or move it to a new WiFi)?
1. Plug the light controller into the wall power (it's not important if the lights are attached).
2. Temporarily switch your phone's WiFi to the "WLED-AP" created by the controller.
3. A form appears, enter your network name and password in the top fields and click "Save & Connect".
4. Connect your phone back to your WiFi network (if it hasn't by itself already)

From now on the controller should automatically reconnect when powered on.

### How can I see and change the configuration?
1. Install the "WLED Native" app on your phone.
2. Open "WLED Native", choose your light strip from the menu.
3. Choose "Config" -> "Usermods", scroll down to "DepartStrip" ...
